This post describes my journey as the Team Leader for Team 10 during T2 and T3, 2017.

I am a final year student at Deakin University studying Bachelor of Information Technology and will be graduating in July 2018. I recently completed two interesting units, SIT 374 - Project Design and SIT 302 - Project Delivery.

## My Capabilities
As the team lead, I was responsible for the overall success of the project. I played a major role in deciding the project architecture, languages and delivered to the team both as the lead programmer and team leader. Please find below the list summarizing my achievements in this project: -
- Experience writing WEB API's. Built a .NET CORE WEB API which utilizes both Box and Google Drive SDK's to integrate both platforms into the application.
- Experience building Single Page Applications using ReactJs. Contributed significantly in the UI development. Wrote code for all events, react lifecycle events and fetching data from API.
- Handled all client communications, discussed ideas, provided updates, responded to suggestions and implemented them.
- Guided my team members so they can contribute to the project using their skills, help them learn new skills, assigned tasks and ensured that project completes on time by overcoming all hurdles.

## Project Assets
The code is in a private repository managed by me. If anyone wants access to the repository, they can use the Contact form to send me an email.

The application is hosted on Azure and is available at [https://docchain.azurewebsites.net](https://docchain.azurewebsites.net).

The Swagger documentation for the API is available at [https://docchain.azurewebsites.net/swagger](https://docchain.azurewebsites.net/swagger)

Please feel free to try the application. It uses external authentication using **Oauth 2.0**. You can log in using your Box or Google Drive account, see all your files and folders, select any file, embed its hash onto the blockchain. You can later come back and check if the file has changed or not.

## Assertion

## Introduction
The Team built an application that allows users to login with their Box or Google Drive account, manage their files and use our BlockChain Infrastructure to verify the integrity of their files.

It is a Single Page Application built using ReactJs with a .NET CORE WEB API as backend. Currently, it also uses a MSSQL database for logging user actions.

Our client [LINCD](https://www.lincd.co/) provides BlockChain Infrastructure as a service. This application is built as proof of concept for client's idea that BlockChain can be used for document integrity verification. In future, the application will be used by lawyers and accountants.
