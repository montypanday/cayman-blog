This post describes my journey as the Team Leader for Team 10 during T2 and T3, 2017.

I am a final year student at Deakin University studying Bachelor of Information Technology and will be graduating in July 2018. I recently completed two interesting units, SIT 374 - Project Design and SIT 302 - Project Delivery.

## Introduction
The Team built an application that allows users to login with their Box or Google Drive account, manage their files and use our BlockChain Infrastructure to verify the integrity of their files.

It is a Single Page Application built using ReactJs with a .NET CORE WEB API as backend. Currently, it also uses a MSSQL database for logging user actions.

Our client [LINCD](https://www.lincd.co/) provides BlockChain Infrastructure as a service. This application is built as proof of concept for client's idea that BlockChain can be used for document integrity verification. In future, the application will be used by lawyers and accountants.

## Project Assets
The code is in a private repository managed by me. If anyone wants access to the repository, they can use the Contact form to send me an email.

The application is hosted on Azure and is available at [https://docchain.azurewebsites.net](https://docchain.azurewebsites.net).

The Swagger documentation for the API is available at [https://docchain.azurewebsites.net/swagger](https://docchain.azurewebsites.net/swagger)

Please feel free to try the application. It uses external authentication using **Oauth 2.0**. You can log in using your Box or Google Drive account, see all your files and folders, select any file, embed its hash onto the blockchain. You can later come back and check if the file has changed or not.

## My Capabilities
As the team lead, I was responsible for the overall success of the project. I played a major role in deciding the project architecture, languages, team management.
