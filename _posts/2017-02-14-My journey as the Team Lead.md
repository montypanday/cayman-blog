This post describes my journey as the Team Leader for Team 10 during T2 and T3, 2017.

I am a final year student at Deakin University studying Bachelor of Information Technology and will be graduating in July 2018. I recently completed two interesting units, SIT 374 - Project Design and SIT 302 - Project Delivery.

## Introduction
The Team built an application that allows users to login with their Box or Google Drive account, manage their files and use our BlockChain Infrastructure to verify the integrity of their files.

It is a Single Page Application built using ReactJs with a .NET CORE WEB API as backend. Currently, it also uses a MSSQL database for logging user actions.

Our client [LINCD](https://www.lincd.co/) provides BlockChain Infrastructure as a service. This application is built as proof of concept for client's idea that BlockChain can be used for document integrity verification. In future, the application will be used by lawyers and accountants.
